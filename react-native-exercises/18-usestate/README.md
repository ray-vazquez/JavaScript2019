# React Native useState Hook Challenge

In Visual Studio code, press `command+shift+v` (Mac) or `ctrl+shift+v` (Windows) to open a Markdown preview.

## Getting Started

Using your command line, you will need to navigate to the _react-native-exercises/18-usestate/GuessingGame/_ folder and install all dependencies.

```bash
cd react-native-exercises/18-usestate/GuessingGame/
code . # If you would like to open this in a separate VSCode window
yarn install
```

To start the app with iOS:

```
react-native run-ios
```

To start the app with Android:

```
react-native run-android
```

## Exercise Instructions

You will be creating a guessing game. The application will pick a random number. The user must guess this number. The application will give the user feedback when he or she makes a guess. ("You are correct!", "Too high!" or "Too low!"). The user can only make three guesses. If the third guess is incorrect, the application will display "The answer was 7!".
