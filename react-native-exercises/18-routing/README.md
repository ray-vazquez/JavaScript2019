# React Native Routing Exercise

You will create a menu that will route to 3 separate components. The routing will work like this:

| Path        | Description of Component                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /           | A component with a menu. The two options should be Rick and Morty or Ron Swanson.                                                                           |
| /rickmorty  | Rick and Morty component, which will display a list of Rick and Morty characters. You will refactor _exercises/15-axios/_ exercise to work in React Native. |
| /ronswanson | A Ron Swanson component, which will display a Ron Swanson quote. You will reactor the _exercises/15-async-await_ exercise to work in React Native.          |

The end product should look like this:
