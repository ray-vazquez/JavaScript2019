# React Ajax Exercise

In Visual Studio code, press `command+shift+v` (Mac) or `ctrl+shift+v` (Windows) to open a Markdown preview.

## Getting Started

Using your command line, you will need to navigate to the _react-exercises/16-ajax/_ folder, install all dependencies, and start the app. You will also be installing
the Axios library on your own.

```bash
cd react-exercises/16-ajax/
code . # If you would like to open this in a separate VSCode window
yarn install
# Take a look at the package.json file.
yarn add axios
# Note that axios is not listed as a dependency in the package.json file.
yarn start
```

If, at any time, you need to stop the app, press `ctrl+c`.

## Exercise Instructions

You will be making an AJAX call to the https://randomuser.me/api?results=500&inc=name,email,picture API to create a user profile search engine. You will be working with _src/components/UserDirectory/UserDirectory.jsx_ file. Further instructions are in this file.
